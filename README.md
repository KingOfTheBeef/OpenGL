# Battle Royale

This is just where I (baky123) will be keeping my OpenGL code until it is fit to merge with the main branch.

An attempt at an online Smash Bros/MOBA game in C++, using SDL, OpenGL and RakNet.

We currently have 3 team members, but if you want to help feel free to fork.

Current code includes second prototype made by KingOfTheBeef. To build, open the .sln and run in VS2015. If it does not build correctly, please either open an issue or fix and open a pull request.

## Team Roles
* KingOfTheBeef (Jonathan) - Game Logic Code
* baky123 (Alec) - OpenGL
* TheGoomy42 (Louis) - Networking code & general organiser
